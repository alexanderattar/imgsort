Imgsort
=======

A Rust thingy that sorts the pixels in an image.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvare/imgsort
cd imgsort
cargo install
imgsort mypic.jpg out.png
```

It will also save the output image in any format
supported by [image](https://docs.rs/image/0.15.0/image/).

## Modes
For now the pixels can be sorted in 7 dimensions:

* the 4 channels in RGBA
* the 3 channels in HSL

For example

```bash
imgsort mypic.jpg lol.jpg --mode sat
```

will sort the pixels according to their saturation values.

## Why
I was just trying out the language ðŸ˜¬.
